# MCP Filesystem Server Fixes

This document describes the fixes and improvements made to address the issues in the MCP filesystem server.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. `delete_file` Function

**Issue:** The `delete_file` function didn't properly verify if the file was actually deleted after the operation.

**Fix:** Added verification after the `os.remove()` call to ensure the file no longer exists:

```python
# Verify the file was actually deleted
if os.path.exists(validated_path):
    return f"Error: Failed to delete file {path}. File still exists."
```

### 2. `move_file` Function

**Issue:** The `move_file` function didn't delete the old file (source file) after moving it to the destination.

**Fix:** 
- Replaced `os.rename()` with `shutil.move()` which better handles cross-device moves
- Added verification to ensure the source file doesn't exist and the destination file does exist after the move:

```python
# Using shutil.move instead of os.rename to better handle cross-device moves
shutil.move(validated_source_path, validated_dest_path)

# Verify the operation succeeded
if not os.path.exists(validated_dest_path):
    return f"Error: Move operation failed. Destination file {destination} does not exist."
if os.path.exists(validated_source_path):
    return f"Error: Move operation incomplete. Source file {source} still exists."
```

## Improvements

### 1. Include Diff in Returned String for Editing Actions

**Improvement:** For all editing actions, if the diff is less than 200 lines, include the diff in the returned string.

**Implementation:** Modified the `track_edit_history` decorator to check the diff size and include it in the result if it's small enough:

```python
# Modify the result to include the diff if it's small enough
if operation in ["edit", "replace", "create"] and diff_content:
    # Count the number of lines in the diff
    diff_lines = diff_content.count('\n')
    if diff_lines < 200:  # Check if the diff is less than 200 lines
        # Add the diff to the result
        modified_result = result
        if not modified_result.endswith('\n'):
            modified_result += '\n'
        modified_result += f"\nDiff ({diff_lines} lines):\n{diff_content}"
        return modified_result
```

### 2. Return Directory Listing for Existing Directories

**Improvement:** For `create_directory`, if the directory already exists, return the `list_directory` of it.

**Implementation:** Modified the `create_directory` function to check if the directory exists and return its listing if it does:

```python
# Check if directory already exists
if os.path.isdir(validated_path):
    # Return the directory listing
    return list_directory(path)
    
# Create the directory
os.makedirs(validated_path, exist_ok=True)
```

## Testing

Basic tests were created to verify the fixes and improvements:

1. `test_filesystem_issues.py` - Tests basic filesystem operations
2. `test_fixes.py` - Verifies the fixes for file deletion, moving, and directory creation

The tests confirmed that the standard filesystem operations are now working correctly.
